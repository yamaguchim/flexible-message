			<p>December 07, 2016 - <span class="highlight">MAN DIES OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AFTER BEING FORCED TO CLEAN WALGREENS BATHROOM.</span> The 69-year-old man was a long-term customer, NOT an employee. Apparently he had made such a mess in the bathroom that the Walgreens employees forced him to stay and clean the bathroom before he left. This traumatized him to the point of death. The deceased man's wife sued Walgreens and the case was immediately dismissed.</p>
